According to the Odin Project, this was supposed to be a practice for flexbox, but it seemed more like I practiced more with DOM manipulation. Overall, as of right now probabbly the most difficult project I have done. With a mixture of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript made things interesting but much more diffiult. The only thing that really made this hard was making a grid where the squares would change in size when a new grid was made. Luckily I solved it by making a for loop create rows of divs but with an inner for loop creating the squares within those rows.
